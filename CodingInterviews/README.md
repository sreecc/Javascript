JavaScript Coding Interviews
Question types to expect, important concepts to know and top practice questions to do
The difference between coding JavaScript coding questions vs algorithmic coding questions is that the former is usually specific to the front end domain and it makes the most sense to use JavaScript (or TypeScript) to complete them. You will also probably need to make use of browser/JavaScript-specific APIs and/or utilize HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge.

These JavaScript coding questions tend to be practical in nature and can come in one or more of the following categories:

Implement standard built-in classes or methods in the JavaScript language.
Implement a utility function/class commonly found in popular libraries.
